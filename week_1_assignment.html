			<h1>Assignment  for the first week:</h1>
			<h3>Make a website!</h3>
<p>On my website, I decided to go ahead with a simple design, basic style, something which I can re-use time and time again with absolutely zero complications, and something that is easy on the eyes.
No flashy colors, no retina-burning white background, no fancy fonts, no scripts, no nothing.
Basic, simple, straightforward HTML.

			<h3>The process!</h3>
			<br>
			<p>The tools I will be using:<br>1. <b>Notepad</b> for the HTML / CSS codes.
			<br>2. <b>Git Bash</b> to commit and upload the web pages.</p><p>I will be following two tutorials for this week:<br>
			1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c">"Learn Git in 20 minutes" Youtube tutotial</a>
			<br>2. <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/">Create an SSH key for Gitlab in Windows</a></p>
			<p>
First, I need to download GIT, to start using Git Bash and to connect to my Fab Academy repo.
</p>

<p>
While it's downloading, I will share some of my CSS code to clarify just how simple I'm making it:</p>

<xmp>
body {
	background-color: #fff3d2;
}
h1 {
	color: #0f0505;
	text-align: center;
}
h3 {
	color: #0f0505;
	text-align: center;
}
p {
	color: black;
	text-align: center;
}
#pages {
	margin: auto;
	padding: 10px;
	position: center;
	text-align: center;
}
#links {
	float: center;
	text-align: center;
	margin: 0 auto;
}
</xmp>
<p>
And the HTML of the website index:</p>

<xmp>
	<head>
		My website for the Fab Academy of 2018
		<title>Dmitri Paley, Fab Academy 2018</title>
		<meta name="dima_paley" content="fabacademy documentation website" />
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="indexstyle.css" type="text/css" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="pages">
			<h1>Navigation hub to different assignments</h1>
		</div>
		<div id="links">
			<h2>Links to the weekly assignments:</h2>
			<a href="week_1_assignment.html">Week 2</a>
			<br><br>
			<a href="week_2_assignment.html">Week 3</a>

	</body>
</xmp>
<p>
The actual page itself:</p>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (219).jpg">
<p>
GIT:<br>
In order to get the website running, of course, I first need to hook up to the Git repository and to get all these Git commands and connections done.
<br>
So first thing's first - I open  git bash from my desired folder (right click on the folder and click "Git bash here".
</p>
<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (240).jpg">
<p>
Then I type in the command:</p>
<code>
Git init
</code>
<p>
In the Git bash.
I was also previously connected to a repository, but after some computer trouble have had to factory reset, so I'm going to run a quick check and see that I'm not connected any more (git fetch origin):</p>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (241).png">
<p>
Nope, not connected. Okay good, so it's actually all from scratch.<br>
So in order to connect to a repository, I need to get the clone url from the repository page.</p>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (242).jpg">
<p>
After I clone it, in Git bash, I type "git remote", Enter, and then "git clone" and paste the repo URL.
So it looks like this:</p>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (243).png">

<p>My machine already has the SSH code in the repo, so I should not have any credential issues when I try to push.</p>
<code>
Git push origin master
</code>
<p>
I'll add a new file to the folder real quick, just a simple txt file called "test.txt":</p>
<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (244).jpg">
<p>
Then I'm gonna run the git push command as specified above.</p>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (245).png">

<p>And it appears that after factory reset, the SSH I had previously is no longer working, as I cannot push the changes to the repo.<br>
Good! This means I'll get to cover that part as well :)</p>
<p>
So, from the GitLab's documentation page (https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ssh/README.html), in Git bash I need to type in the command:</p>
<code>
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your.email@example.com" -b 4096
</code>
<p>
Of course my own email is not "your.email@example.com" so I substitude that with mine.
I pasted the command, gave it some time, and when it was done generating the key it prompted me to specify a directory to put the key in.</p>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (246).png">
<p>
I simply clicked enter, using the default.<br>
And the SSH is done!</p>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (248).png">
<p>
To copy the SSH, I need to run the windows command terminal and type in the following command:</p>
<code>
type %userprofile%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | clip
</code>
<br><br>
<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (249).png">
<p>
Which I have done, and then simply followed the next step in the documentation:<br>
"Navigate to the 'SSH Keys' tab in your 'Profile Settings'. Paste your key in the 'Key' section and give it a relevant 'Title'."</p>
<p>
So now on my settings page I have the SSH:</p>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (250).jpg">
<p>
And time to test the push origin master command again!<br>
But before I do, I actually forgot a couple of intermediary commands as well, which are:<br>
"git add." and "git commit -m 'comment'"</p>
<p>
So just to be sure, I closed bash, then opened it again.
I also typed in "cd dmitri-paley" which should read from my actual cloned repo folder now.<br>
Running "git remote -v" to test if there's a connection, there appears to be:</p>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (251).png">
<p>
NOW I add the "test.txt" file into the "dmitri-paley" folder (I really forgot how to use git, so bear with me while I stumble around to success here), and check with "git status":<br>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (252).png">
<p>
Okay, so it's showing right.<br>
So now we know the drill - "git add ." then "git commit -m comment", then "git push origin master":</p>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (253).png">
<p>
And on the repo itself:</p>
<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (254).jpg">
<p>
Great! Excellent, so it's now pushing, and I got a good connection going on. Excellent.
<br>
One last thing left to change - in the index CSS file, I'm going to change the color hash.<br>
Instead of fff3d2, I'm changing it to ff1111, which I don't know what result it will actually bring, but likely not be the nice creamy color I initially set up.</p>
<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (255).jpg">
<p>
I commit and push the changes with git, and then open the website.</p>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (256).jpg">
<p>
TA DA! It is hideous, but also shows that everything works correctly.
Changing it back in the CSS and pushing it again:</p>

<img src ="./websitebuild/Screenshot (257).jpg">
<p>
It's back to normal, and the website is ready to have pages and files pushed to it through Git.<br>
Happy end!</p>
